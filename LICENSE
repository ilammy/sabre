*Sabre* is dual-licensed under Apache Software License 2.0 (see LICENSE.Apache)
and MIT License (see LICENSE.MIT). This means that you as a user can choose to
be granted rights for this software as provided by any one of these licenses.

The main reason for choosing this strategy is to be compatible with majority
of Rust projects which use MIT/Apache-2.0 licensing. They, in turn, use it
mainly to enjoy ASL's patent protection and MIT's compatibility with GPL.

For contributors this means that you must license your contributions under the
same dual license. You do not need to sign any contributor license agreement,
put sign-offs in your commit messages, or litter the boilerplate comments with
your copyright lines. By intentionally submitting any contribution you:

  1) agree to license the contribution under the terms specified above,

  2) confirm that you have legal authority to do so,

  3) retain any rights that you have for the contribution,

  4) do not acquire any additional obligations (such as providing support)
     connected to the contribution,

  5) agree to permanently record the authorship of the intellectual
     property in Git history of the project.

You may use the wording "not a contribution" to explicitly disclaim the above.
